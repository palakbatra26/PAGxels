✨ About the Project
I created PAGxels – a powerful 3D asset generation model designed to bring creative ideas to life from just text or image prompts. Built around a structured latent representation (SLAT), this model can seamlessly generate multiple types of 3D output including Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, and meshes, enabling flexibility for a wide range of applications from game design to AR/VR.

The project is powered by Rectified Flow Transformers, fine-tuned on a massive dataset of 500,000 3D objects. TRELLIS stands out by supporting local edits and multiple format outputs — making it both scalable and versatile for real-world 3D generation needs.


🌟 Key Features
🎨 Creative & High Quality: Generates high-fidelity 3D shapes with realistic textures and structures.

🔁 Multiple Output Formats: Choose from Radiance Fields, 3D Gaussians, Meshes, etc., based on your project needs.

🛠️ Editable Assets: Easily tweak or modify generated assets for local editing or multiple variants.

🧠 Text & Image-Based Prompts: Generate 3D objects from either natural language descriptions or reference images.
